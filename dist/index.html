                            Most of us have a to-do list. But legendary management guru Tom Peters also has what he
                            calls “to don’t” list – an inventory of behaviours and practices that sap his energy, divert
                            his focus, and ought to be avoided. Follow his lead and each week craft your own agenda of
                            avoidance. Staying motivated – directing your own life, making progress, and pursuing
                            purpose – isn’t easy. So get rid of the unnecessary obligations, time-wasting distractions,
                            and useless burdens that stand in your way. And the first step in bulldozing these obstacles
                            is to enumerate them. As Peters puts it, “What you decide not to do is probably more
                            important than what you decide to do.”

                        </h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p>
                            One key to mastery is what Florida State University psychology professor Anders Ericsson
                            calls deliberate practice – a ‘lifelong period of… effort to improve performance in a
                            specific domain.’ Deliberate practice isn’t running a few miles each day or banging on the
                            piano for twenty minutes each morning. It’s much more purposeful, focused, and, yes painful.
                            Follow these steps – over and over again for a decade – and you just might become a master:
                            Remember that deliberate practise has one objective: to improve performance. ‘People who
                            play tennis once a week for years don’t get any better if they do the same thing each time,’
                            Ericsson has said. ‘Deliberate practise is about changing your performance, setting new
                            goals and straining yourself to reach a bit higher each time.’ Repeat, repeat, repeat. 
                            Repetition matters. Basketball greats don’t shoot ten free throws at the end of team practise; 
                            they shoot five hundred. Seek constant, critical feedback. If you don’t know how you’re doing, 
                            you won’t know what to improve. Focus ruthlessly on where you need help. While many of us work 
                            on what we’re already good at, says Ericsson, ‘those who get better work on their weaknesses.’ 
                            Prepare for the process to be mentally and physically exhausting. That’s why so few people 
                            commit to it, but that’s why it works.

                            An interesting opinion piece by Thomas Friedman in the New York Times on the new book Why
                            Nations Fail, co-authored by the M.I.T. economist Daron Acemoglu and the Harvard political
                            scientist James A. Robinson. The more you read it, the more you appreciate what a fool’s

                            Jessica Lester’s friends persuaded her to date Matthew Boynton, a boy in the eleventh grade,
                            by saying, “If you don’t like him, you can always break up.” He was the grandson of the
                            sheriff of Spalding County, where they lived, an hour south of Atlanta, and his friends were
                            football players and cheerleaders. Jessica thought that Matthew, who was baby-faced but
                            muscular, looked rich; he wore Ralph Lauren boots and collared shirts from Hollister.
                            Jessica, who was in tenth grade, was less popular. She wore hand-me-downs and liked to take
                            nature photographs. Her parents had abandoned her when she was three, along with her sister
                            and brother, and she grew up on a farm with her mother’s adoptive parents. “I guess she felt
                            like ‘Matthew could have picked anybody, and for some reason he picked me,’ ” her sister,
                            Dusty, said.
